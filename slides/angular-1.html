        <li>Before we can understand how Angular2 blends the best of Angular 1, React and Flux into Flux Plus we need to
            understand change detection and data flow in Angular 1</li>
        <li>Angular 1 uses a bidirectional data flow pattern; obviously this means data flows up and down the object
            graph. What may not be obvious is why that matters, so we'll take a look at the negatives associated
            with two-way data flow.</li>
        <li>Angular uses the digest cycle and dirty checking to propagate actions from app code to data model.</li>
        <li>With these two key factors in mind, we can see that Angular 1.x does not separate the concerns of
            application model and presentation layer. We all know that separation of concerns is
            a good thing, but we'll see some examples of how it's specifically problematic in an Angular context.</li>
