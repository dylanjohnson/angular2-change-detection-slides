        <li>Many introductory Angular tutorials highlight the “magic” of two-way data binding, showing a text input
            updating a binding on some other element; this is two-way binding, a model that can be written to and read
            from. Indeed, two-way binding trivializes tasks that were previously difficult, like updating the
            representation of relational models.</li>
